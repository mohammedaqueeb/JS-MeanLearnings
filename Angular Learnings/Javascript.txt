What is Javascript
	
	JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. 
	
	It's used to add features like: 
	Interactivity
		JavaScript can make web pages more interactive by allowing them to respond to user input. For example, a web page can have a form that uses JavaScript to generate a custom response based on the user's input. 
	
	Visual feedback
		JavaScript can provide visual feedback or animations to improve the user experience. 
	
	Multimedia
		JavaScript can control multimedia, such as animated 2D and 3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, and more. 
	
	Database-driven apps
		JavaScript can be used to create comprehensive database-driven apps. 
	
	Mobile apps
		JavaScript frameworks like React Native, Ionic, NativeScript, and Apache Cordova can be used to build native and hybrid mobile apps for Android and iOS. 
	
	
	Javascript is a single threaded, non blocking, asynchronous concurrent language
	It has a call stack, an event loop and a callback queue and others APIs
	The heap is used for memory allocation and the stack holds the execution context
	
	
	JavaScript is a single-threaded language that executes one task at a time.
	It is an Interpreted language which means it executes the code line by line.
	The data type of the variable is decided at run-time in JavaScript that’s why it is called dynamically typed.
	
	
What is ES6	

	ES6 is a new standardized version of javascript that was released in 2015. It is also known as ECMAScript 2015. 
	ES6 has many new features that can help a developer understand and write code more efficiently. 
	With a lot of forward-thinking features (ES6) attached to it, JavaScript is an exciting language to program.
	
	Features od ES6
		
	Let and const: New variable declarations that allow you to define variables and constants: 
		let: Allows a block scope for variables 
		const: Defines a constant that cannot be reassigned 
		
	Arrow functions: A more concise syntax for writing function expressions 
	
	Multi-line strings: Create multi-line strings by using back-ticks (`), and insert data into strings using template literals 
	
	Destructuring assignment: Extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables 
	
	Spread and rest operators: Spread the elements of an array into individual variables or combine variables into an array 
	
	Promises: A method for writing asynchronous code 
	
	Modules: Divide the code into importable modules 
	
	Classes: Introduce object-oriented programming with classes, constructors, and inheritance 
	
Event loop
	
	The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
	
	The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed
	
	console.log('Start script...');
	setTimeout(() => {
		console.log('Download a file.');
	}, 1000);
	console.log('Done!');
	
	In our example, when calling the setTimeout() function, the JavaScript engine places it on the call stack, and the Web API creates a timer that expires in 1 second.
	
What is stack or call stack

	A stack is an ordered collection of items that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The addition and removal of items take place at the same end, i.e. at the top. The newest elements are at the top, and the oldest elements are at the bottom
	
Event queue or Callback queue

	The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.

SingleTon 

	Singleton is a design pattern that tells us that we can create only one instance of a class and that instance can be accessed globally.
	
	In JavaScript, a singleton is a design pattern that ensures a class only has one instance throughout an application. The singleton instance is the central point of access for all data and methods associated with the class
	
State
	https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/state	
	
Promise
	By definition, a promise is an object that encapsulates the result of an asynchronous operation.
	Promises are a good way to replace callbacks and are useful to make asynchronous javascript code.
	A promise object has a state that can be one of the following:
		Pending
		Fulfilled with a value
		Rejected for a reason
		
Difference between promise.all, promise.race,  promise.allSettled

	
	Promise.all will reject as soon as one of the Promises in the array rejects.
	
	Promise.all([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.resolve(2)]).then(console.log);

	Promise.allSettled will never reject - it will resolve once all Promises in the array have either rejected or resolved.
	
	Promise.allSettled([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.resolve(2)]).then(console.log);
	
	Promise.race returns as soon as one of the promises in the iterable is settled. It's a race to see which promise settles first. This can be useful in scenarios where you only need the result of the first settled promise.

	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3eNcjoJYRE&list=PLolI8AY2AS9YBo2MsLpFqSfws1UwzmcQe&index=31
	
Ajax vs Promise
	Ajax is a way to comunicate to a service or api provided by javascript and promises are a type of object, a completely different things. Promises are a good way to replace callbacks and are useful to make asynchronous javascript code.
	
	
Hoisting
	Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope.
	JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, 
	prior to execution of the code
	
	Variables declared with var are hoisted but have a default value of undefined


Call vs Apply vs Bind
     call,apply,bind is a function that you use to change the value of this inside a function and execute it with the arguments provided.
	 
     Call => Call is a function that helps you change the context of the invoking function. In layperson's terms, it helps you replace the value of this inside a function with whatever value you want.
     Apply=> Apply is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an array as an argument list.
     Bind => Bind is a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later with the new context of this that is provided.
	 
	
	call : binds the this value, invokes the function, and allows you to pass a list of arguments. 
	apply : binds the this value, invokes the function, and allows you to pass arguments as an array. 
	bind : binds the this value, returns a new function, and allows you to pass in a list of arguments
	
	
	let nameObj = {
		name: "Tony"
	}

	let PrintName = {
		name: "steve",
		sayHi: function (age) {
			console.log(this.name + " age is " + age);
		}
	}

	PrintName.sayHi.call(nameObj, 42);
	
	PrintName.sayHi.Apply(nameObj, [42]);
	
	let HiFun = PrintName.sayHi.bind(nameObj);
	HiFun();
	
	

Closure :- 
        
		1)Function along with it's lexical enviornment forms a closure
		  
		This is closure in action that is inner function can have access to the outer function variables as well as all the global variables
		Advantages of closure
			1. data hiding and encapsulation
			
		Disadvantages of closure
			1. Memory consumption
			

Closure Memory leaks
	
		When the closure is returned and invoked, the data it holds in memory is not destroyed, and it can be accessed in the program at any time, leading to a memory leak

Currying

	Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.

	Instead of taking all arguments at once, the curried function takes the first argument, returns a new function 	that takes the next argument, and so on until all arguments are provided. The final function then returns the 	result.
	
	function sum(a) {
		return (b) => {
			return (c) => {
				return a + b + c
			}
		}
	}
	console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)) // 6


promises  =>

			Async => The async keyword is used to define a function that returns a promise. 
					An async function implicitly returns a promise that resolves with the return value of the function.
			Await => The await keyword is used within an async function to pause the execution of the function until the promise is settled (resolved or rejected).
              It allows you to work with promises in a synchronous-like manner.
              Using async and await makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain, especially for developers who are more familiar with synchronous programming paradigms.


prototype :- 

		Whenever we create any object,array or function at that time javascript engine attaches one object to that created array or object which contains some prooperties.
              -lets take an example of array when we create array javascript engine attaches on object to that array which haver properties like push,pop.
              -A prototype is an object, where it can add new variables and methods to the existing object

prototype inheritance 			

		In JavaScript, prototype inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects through a chain of prototypes, enabling code reuse and extensibility. Here's a simple example: 
		
		function Animal(name) {
		  this.name = name;
		}

		Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
		  console.log(this.name + " makes a sound.");
		};


difference in = filter , map an reduce

	map: creates a new array by transforming every element in an array individually. 
	filter: creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong. 
	reduce: on the other hand, takes all of the elements in an array and reduces them into a single value
	
	const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

	// 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
	const initialValue = 0;
	const sumWithInitial = array1.reduce(
	  (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
	  initialValue,
	);

	console.log(sumWithInitial);

this keyword :-

	 => 1)In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
		2)Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
		3)In an object method, this refers to the object.
		4)Alone, this refers to the global object.
		5)Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

DOM , document vs window

	- window is the global object, you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window.
	- whenever we run javascript program...at that time javascript engine parsed the html code and creates an a object which called document.
	  document object placed inside windows object
	  using document object we can render html dynamically

DOM (Document Object Model)
	The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page which can be modify with a scripting language such as js 
		
Shadow Dom
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AK98MpCc30
	When we open a webpage in browser then a Dom tree are created for that. So that we can see the page view. And inside the main dom there is also a hidden DOM which we call shadow DOM. And here the dom does not accept the style of the main DOM or actuall DOM
	Use: For resolving conflicting style we can use it
	Custom Element:
		customElements.define(
			'my-tag-name', 						// name of element
			class extends HTMLElement{ 			// class fo the custom element 
				connectedCallback(){ 			// life cycle hook of js
					const temp = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })
					temp.innerHTML = `<p class="error"> This is dynamic data: ${this.getAttribute('mydata')} </p>`
				}
			}
		)
		<my-tag-name mydata="daynamicData" ></my-tag-name>
		
Arrow function vs traditional function
   =>Syntax
   =>Arrow function is not hoisted
   =>No own this (call, apply & bind won't work as expected)
   =>No prototype object for the Arrow function
   =>Cannot be invoked with a new keyword (Not a constructor function)

callback function
	A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
	This technique allows a function to call another function
	A callback function can run after another function has finished
	
	
	// function
	function greet(name, callback) {
		console.log('Hi' + ' ' + name);
		callback();
	}

	// callback function
	function callMe() {
		console.log('I am callback function');
	}

	// passing function as an argument
	greet('Peter', callMe);


difference between Callback function VS Higher-order function

	Callback function
	A function that is passed to another function and executed after a specific task is completed. Callback functions are often used in asynchronous operations, such as handling the completion of an asynchronous task. 
	
	
	Higher-order function
	A function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions allow for the creation of more abstract and reusable code. 
	


Difference between normal function and arrow function in javascript
	
	Regular 											| 									Arrow
	: Arguments object inside the regular functions  		The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn’t define arguments
	  contains the list of arguments. 						i.e. they do not have arguments binding.
	: Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this  		The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same 
	  value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that  	throughout the lifecycle
	  the value of this depends on how the function is 
	  invoked.
	: Regular functions are constructible and callable.  	But, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible,
	  They can be called using the new keyword. 			i.e., arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions
	  
Shallo copy vs Deep Copy
   -Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address.
   -Deep copy stores copies of the object’s value.
   
   Deep copy: deep copy makes a copy of all the members of the old object, allocates separate memory location for the new object and 
		then assigns the copied members to the new object.
		In this way, both the objects are independent of each other and in case of any modification to either one the other is not affected.
		Now to create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript we use JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods

Shadowing :-
   - when a variable is declared in a certain scope having the same name defined on its outer scope and when we call the variable from the inner scope,
     the value assigned to the variable in the inner scope is the value that will be stored in the variable in the memory space

Generator function in javascript

	A generator function uses the yield keyword to generate values, pausing execution and sending values to the caller. It retains the state to resume execution after yield, continuing immediately after the last yield run.
	
	Using a generator, you can stop the execution of a function from anywhere inside the function. Some of the generator Methods is bwlow.
		
		Method				| 			Description
		next()							Returns a value of yield
		return()						Returns a value and terminates the generator
		throw()							Throws an error and terminates the generator
		
	calling function
	
	function* generator(i) {
	  yield i;
	  yield i + 10;
	}

	const gen = generator(10);

	console.log(gen.next().value); #10
	console.log(gen.next().value); #20
	console.log(gen.next().value); #undefined
	
	
	
Pass by value and pass by referance
	Pass by Value means that when you pass a variable to a function,
	Pass by Reference means that when you pass a variable (specifically, objects or arrays) to a function,

undefined vs null 
	Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value.

Lexical Enviornment
	Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, Lexical Environement is the local
	memory along with the lexical environment of its parent
	Lexical: In hierarchy, In order
	
Lexical Scope or static scope
	Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope. 
	We call the child function to be lexically bound by that of the parent function
	
Spread operators vs Rest Operators
	- Spread operators are used using triple dots, using spread operators we can merge of add array or object.
	- Rest operator is also denoted using triple dots's
	
	The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
	function test(a, b, ...c){  }
	
	The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
	test(...data)


Temporal dead zone in js
	A time difference in between variable declaration and a value assign to that variable is called Temporal dead zone


synchronous and asynchronous in javascript with example
	Synchronous JavaScript: As the name suggests synchronous means to be in a sequence, i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by one. 
	So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement to get executed
	
	Asynchronous JavaScript: Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately or parallel where the synchronous code will block further 
	execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one. 
	This may not look like a big problem but when you see it in a bigger picture you realize that it may lead to delaying the User Interface.


Difference between primitive and non primitive data types in javascript
	(https://dev.to/js_catch/02-primitive-and-non-primitive-data-types-in-javascript-2dhd)
	Primitive 										| 						Nonprimitive
	: Primitive values are immutable (Immutable  		Non-primitive values are mutable (Mutable values are those
	  values are those which cannot be modified  		which can be modified after creation)
	  after creation)
	: Primitives are stored by value 					Non-Primitive (objects) are stored by reference.
	: Example: string, number, boolean, null, 			Example: Object and array
	  undefined
	  
	  
Higher order function
	Basically, a function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function is known as a higher order function
	another example of Higher order function are (map,filter,forEach,find);
		
	// Higher-order function that takes a function as an argument
	function greet(name, greetingFunction) {
	  return greetingFunction(name);
	}

	// Callback function (a function passed as an argument)
	function sayHello(name) {
	  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
	}

	// Call the higher-order function
	console.log(greet("Alice", sayHello)); // Output: Hello, Alice!
	
What is the polyfill in JavaScript
	A polyfill is a code that implements a feature on a web browser that does not support the feature like a JS library that implements an HTML5 or CSS web standard .
	
	Polyfills are used to bring new or standardized features to older browsers or environments that do not inherently support those features. When new JavaScript features are introduced or when web standards evolve, not all browsers immediately implement those changes.
	
	
Function scope and block scope in javascript 	
	(https://www.programiz.com/javascript/variable-scope)
	(https://www.educative.io/answers/difference-between-var-let-and-const-keyword-in-javascript)

	let a = 'Hello';
	function greet() {
		// local variable
		let b = 'World';
		console.log(a + ' ' + b);
		if (b == 'World') {
			// block-scoped variable
			let c = 'hello';
			console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c);
		}
		// variable c cannot be accessed here
		console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c);
	}
	greet();
	
	OUTPUT : ReferenceError: c is not defined
	
	Note: change let c to var c and check what happens
	
	1. Output ?
		for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		  console.log(i);
		}
		console.log(i);
	2.	Output ?
		for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		  console.log(i);
		}
		console.log(i);
		
	=> 	var 					| 				let 					|  				const
		function scope						block scope								block scope
		Reassign Allowed					Reassign Allowed						Not Reassign Allowed
		Hoisting Allowed					Not Hoisting Allowed 					Not Hoisting Allowed
		Redeclaration Allowed 				Not Redeclaration Allowed 				Not Redeclaration  Allowed

What is Destructuring in ES6 ?
	Destructuring in ES6 is a convenient feature that allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a more concise and readable way. It simplifies the process of extracting specific data from complex structures.
	
	
	const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

	// Destructuring assignment
	const [a, b, c] = numbers;

	console.log(a); // Output: 1
	console.log(b); // Output: 2
	console.log(c); // Output: 3
	
	
	const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

	// Destructuring assignment
	const { name, age } = person;

	console.log(name); // Output: John
	console.log(age);  // Output: 30
	
	
	// Destructuring function parameters
	function printPersonDetails({ name, age }) {
	  console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`);
	}

	const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 28 };
	printPersonDetails(person);
	// Output: Name: Alice, Age: 28
		
What is an event bubbling in JavaScript?

	Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM where an event triggered in an element inside another element bubbles up through the hierarchy. When both the inner and outer elements have event listeners registered for the same event, event bubbling ensures the event is first handled by the innermost element and then propagated outward to the containing elements.

	How Event Bubbling Works
	When an event occurs, it starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to its parent elements, moving up the DOM tree. In bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element before it moves outward to the outer elements.
	
	
	To prevent event bubbling, you use the stopPropagation method of the event object.
	
	button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
	  event.stopPropagation()
	  console.log("button was clicked")
	})
	
	<div id="parent">
        <button>
            <h2>Parent</h2>
        </button>
        <button id="child">

            <p>Child</p>

        </button>
    </div><br>


    <script>
        document.getElementById(
            "child").addEventListener("click", function () {
                alert("You clicked the Child element!");
            }, false);

        document.getElementById(
            "parent").addEventListener("click", function () {
                alert("You clicked the parent element!");
            }, false);
    </script>
	
	event capturing
	
	So, the process of propagating from the farthest element to the closest element in the DOM is called event capturing. Both terms are just opposite of each other.


	<div id="grandparent">GrandParent
		<div id="parent">Parent</div>
	</div>
		
    <script>
        const grandParent = document.getElementById("grandparent");
        const parent = document.getElementById("parent");
        const child = document.getElementById("child");
         
        // Changing value of capture parameter as 'true'
        grandParent.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
            console.log("GrandParent");
        }, { capture: true });
        parent.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
            console.log("Parent");
        }, { capture: true });
    </script>

What is the difference between event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()?

	event.preventDefault() is used to prevent the default action that belongs to the event, such as preventing a form from submitting. 
	
	event.stopPropagation() is used to stop the event from bubbling up to parent elements, preventing any parent event handlers from being executed.

What is event listener

	An event listener is basically a function that waits for an event to occur. That event can be anything like a mouse click event, submitting a form, pressing keys of a keyboard, etc.
	
	An event listener contains three parameters and it can be defined using the following syntax.

	<element>: The element to which an event listener is attached.
	<eventName>: It can be ‘click’,’key up’,’key down’ etc. events.
	<callbackFunction>: This function fires after the event happened.
	{capture: boolean}: It tells whether the event will be in the capture phase or in the bubbling phase (optional)
	
	const grandParent = document.getElementById("grandparent");

	grandParent.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
		console.log("GrandParent");
	}, { capture: false });


What is map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, retryWhen etc.

	When to use forEach?
	.forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array.

	When to use map?
	.map() when you want to transform elements in an array.

	When to use filter?
	.filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.

	When to use find?
	.find() When you want to select a single element from an array.

	When to use reduce?
	.reduce() when you want derive a single value from multiple elements in an array.
	
	
Who can i swap two variables values without using third variable
		
		Using Bitwise XOR

			a = 20; 
			b = 40;

			a = a ^ b;
			b = a ^ b;
			a = a ^ b;

			console.log('After Bitwise XOR:');
			console.log('a:', a); // 40

		Using Array Destructuring
		
			a = 20;
			b = 40;

			[a, b] = [b, a];

			console.log('After Array Destructuring:');
			console.log('a:', a); // 40
			console.log('b:', b); // 20
			
		Compound Assignment Swap (Single Line Swap)
		
			a = 20;
			b = 40;

			a = a + b - (b = a);

			console.log('After Compound Assignment Swap:');
			console.log('a:', a); // 40
			console.log('b:', b); // 20


use of async and await in javascript
	async and await make promises easier to write. async makes a function return a Promise. await makes a function wait for a Promise.
	
Difference between getElementByID and querySelector in js
	getElementById matches the id attributes to find DOM nodes, 
	while querySelector searches by selectors

	
How can you detect the client's browser name?
	This function will analyze the navigator.userAgent string, which contains information about the user's browser, operating system, and other details. We'll search for specific strings indicative of popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, and Internet Explorer.
	
	function detectBrowser() {
		var userAgent = navigator.userAgent;
		if (userAgent.indexOf("Chrome") > -1) {
			return "Chrome";
		} else if (userAgent.indexOf("Firefox") > -1) {
			return "Firefox";
		}

		return "Unknown";
	}



How to create global function in javascript

	Everything in JS is bound to containing scope. Therefore, if you define a function directly in file, it will be bound to window object, i.e. it will be global.


how delete a property from object in javascript
	Using the delete operator
	
		let person = {
			firstName: "John",
			lastName: "Doe",
			gender: "Male",
			age: 34
		};

		// Delete the age property first
		delete person.age;
		let json = JSON.stringify(person);
		console.log(json);
		
	Using object destructuring
	
	    const person = {
			firstName: "John",
			lastName: "Doe",
			gender: "Male",
			age: 34
		};

		// Destructure the age and gender
		const {age, gender, ...personTrimmed} = person;
		const json = JSON.stringify(personTrimmed);
		console.log(json);



How does Type Of Operator work?

	Typeof in JavaScript is an operator used for type checking and returns the data type of the operand passed to it. The operand can be any variable, function, or object whose type you want to find out using the typeof operator

	Attributes are used to provide additional information about an HTML element and are defined in the opening tag of an HTML element. They are used to give more details about the element, such as the ID, class, or style. These attributes are only used when the page is first loaded and cannot be changed by JavaScript.

	Properties, on the other hand, are the values that can be accessed and modified through the DOM with JavaScript. Elements in the DOM have properties such as "style," "value," and "textContent" that can be programmatically accessed and modified.
	


List out the different ways an HTML element can be accessed in a JavaScript code.

	getElementById(element_ID);
	document.getElementsByClassName(element_classnames);
	document.getElementsByName(element_name);
	document.getElementsByTagName(Tag_name);
	
	document.querySelector(selectors);
	document.querySelectorAll(selectors);
	

What is a Typed language?

	In a typed language, variables and values have types. There are languages that determine the types of variables in a program at compile-time. We call them statically-typed.

	On the other hand, in some languages, we can only determine types of variables at runtime. We therefore call them dynamically-typed.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
	NaN stands for Not a Number, it is a value in JavaScript used to represent an undefined or unrepresentable value.

What is the ‘Strict’ mode in JavaScript and how can it be enabled?

	You can enable strict mode in two different ways, globally and locally.

	Enable strict mode globally by adding the string "use strict" as the first statement in your file. All subsequent code in the script will execute in strict mode.
	
	In strict mode, you cannot use undeclared variables, among other enforced rules. Using “use strict”; eliminates silent errors, enhances performance, disables unsafe features, and makes code more secure and easier to debug.
	
	Eliminates Silent Errors: Converts JavaScript silent errors into throw errors, making debugging easier.
	
	Optimization: Helps JavaScript engines perform optimizations, potentially making strict mode code run faster than non-strict code.
	
	Future-Proofing: Prohibits syntax likely to be defined in future ECMAScript versions.
	
	Prevents Unsafe Actions: Throws errors when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken, such as accessing the global object.
	
	Disables Confusing Features: Disables features that are confusing or poorly designed.
	
	Security: Makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript
	
	The "use strict" directive in JavaScript can only be placed at the beginning of a script or at the beginning of a function body. Placing it in the middle of a script will not have the intended effect, and the code after the directive will not be executed in strict mode. JavaScript engines typically ignore "use strict" directives that are not at the beginning of a script or function.
	
	Advantages

	Makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.
	Makes assignments which would otherwise silently fail to throw an exception.
	Makes attempts to delete undeletable properties throw an exception (where before the attempt would simply have no effect).
	Requires that function parameter names be unique.
	this is undefined in the global context.
	It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
	It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.
	
	
	Disadvantages

	Many missing features that some developers might be used to.
	No more access to function.caller and function.arguments.
	Concatenation of scripts written in different strict modes might cause issues.

What is the working of timers in JavaScript?
	A timer is used to execute some task after a particular time interval. Basically, with the help of a timer in JavaScript, we can delay the code execution. With the help of the timer function in JavaScript, we can achieve asynchronous functionality also.
	
	JavaScript provides two functions to delay the execution of tasks. These are timer functions.

	setTimeout function
	setInterval function
	
	To clear timers 
	
	const myTimeout = setTimeout(function(){ console.log('abc')}, 3000);
	clearTimeout(myTimeout);
	
	consr intervals = setInterval(function () {element.innerHTML += "Hello"}, 1000);
	clearInterval(interval)
	
	setImmediate(function(){ console.log })
	
	
	
What is called Variable typing in Javascript?

	the type of a variable is determined only when a value is assigned and can change as the variable appears in different contexts. Usually, you don't have to worry about the type; JavaScript figures out what you want and just does it.
	
	
What is break and continue statements?

	The break statement terminates a while or for loop completely. 
	The continue statement terminates execution of the statements within a while or for loop and continues the loop in the next iteration.
	
	
What are the two basic groups of data types in JavaScript?

		Primitive Types
		Reference Types | Non Primitive Types
		
		 The primitive data types in JavaScript include string, number, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol.
		 The non-primitive data type includes the object.
		 
		
What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?

	Syntax error - The error occurs when you use a predefined syntax incorrectly.
	const func = () =>
		console.log(hello)
	}
	
	Reference Error - In a case where a variable reference can't be found or hasn't been declared, then a Reference error occurs.
	console.log(x);
            ^
	ReferenceError: x is not defined
	
	
	Type Error - An error occurs when a value is used outside the scope of its data type.	
	
	let num = 15;
	console.log(num.split("")); //converts a number to an array
	TypeError: num.split is not a function
	
	
	Internal Error - In the JS engine, this error occurs most often when there is too much data and the stack exceeds its critical size. When there are too many recursion patterns, switch cases, etc., the JS engine gets overwhelmed.

callback hell
	A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function in JavaScript. It is invoked after the completion of an asynchronous operation, allowing code to run after a task is done. Callbacks enable non-blocking, sequential execution of tasks in asynchronous programming.
	
	
	Callback Hell
	Callback hell refers to the situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callbacks create complex, deeply indented code, often called the “pyramid of doom.” This structure makes the code difficult to read, debug, and maintain, resulting in poor code quality and scalability issues.
	
	
	const animateAll = (animate) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            animate(words[0]);
            setTimeout(() => {
                animate(words[1]);
                setTimeout(() => {
                    animate(words[2]);
                }, 1000)
            }, 1000)
        }, 1000)
    }


diffrence between for in & for of

	for in loops over enumerable property names of an object.

	for of (new in ES6) does use an object-specific iterator and loops over the values generated by that.

	let list = [4, 5, 6];
	
	let list = {abc:2,efc: 2}

	for (let i in list) {
	   console.log(i); // "0", "1", "2",
	   console.log(i); // "abc", "efg"
	}

	for (let i of list) {
	   console.log(i); // 4, 5, 6
	}

what is synchronous and asynchronous in javascript

	Synchronous
	A blocking architecture where tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other. Each task must finish before the next can start.
	
	Asynchronous
	A non-blocking architecture where tasks can run simultaneously and independently. The program can continue running while waiting for some tasks to finish


Difference Between indexOf and findIndex function of array

	both will return the index of array the difference is where we are using it findIndex uses for array of object while index of use in string array

	if dealing with array of objects then use findIndex();
	
	if its array then use indexOf().
	
	
	let fruits = [ { type: "Apple", quantity: 9 }];
	let myIndex = fruits.findIndex(fruit => fruit.type === "Apple"); // Returns 0.
	
	
	let fruits = [ "Apple", "Banana", "Pear", "Orange"];
	let index = fruits.indexOf("Orange"); // Returns 3.


Nullish coalescing operator (??) 
	
	The nullish coalescing (??) operator is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. It’s commonly used to provide default values for variables.
	
	function foo(bar) { 
		bar = bar ?? 55; 
		console.log(bar); 
	} 
	foo(); // 55 
	foo(22); // 22
	
	
how to call asyn function when we dont have await
	An async function can contain an await expression, that pauses the execution of the async function and waits for the passed Promise's resolution, and then resumes the async function's execution and returns the resolved value.
	
	if no await is present, the execution is not paused and your code will then be executed synchronously as normal.
	

why Promise is faster than settimeout 

	Timeouts and Promises both serve to execute code in an asynchronous way but with differences characteristics and purposes:

	setTimeout - Delays the execution of a function by specific time duration. - Does not block the rest of the code execution (asynchronous behavior) - They create Macrotask (browser internal operation)

	Promises - They are a wrapper to allow asynchronous execution of code(Eg: an ajax call). (Does not depend on specific time duration) - They are especially useful to chain different async calls. - Does not block the rest of the code execution (asynchronous behavior) at less you are using the await operator. - They create Microtask (browser internal operation), which have priority over the Macrotask.
	
Debounce vs. Throttle
	
	Debounce and throttle are both techniques used in JavaScript to control the rate at which a function is executed, particularly in response to frequent events like scrolling, resizing, or user input. However, they achieve this control in different ways, making them suitable for different scenarios. 
	
	
	Debounce:
	
		It ensures that a function is only executed after a specified delay has passed since the last time the event was triggered. In other words, it groups multiple sequential calls into a single one. If the event occurs again within the delay period, the timer is reset, and the function execution is postponed until the delay has elapsed without any further events.
		
		// Debounce function
		function debounce(func, delay) {
		  let timeoutId;
		  return function(...args) {
			clearTimeout(timeoutId);
			timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
			  func.apply(this, args);
			}, delay);
		  };
		}
		
		
	Throttle: 
		
		It limits the rate at which a function can be executed. It ensures that the function is called at most once within a specified time interval. If the event occurs multiple times during the interval, only the first event will trigger the function, and subsequent events will be ignored until the interval has passed.
		
		// Throttle function
		function throttle(func, limit) {
		  let inThrottle;
		  return function(...args) {
			if (!inThrottle) {
			  func.apply(this, args);
			  inThrottle = true;
			  setTimeout(() => inThrottle = false, limit);
			}
		  }
		}

Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax?
	
	Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They are particularly useful for maintaining the this context within methods and callbacks. For example, in an event handler or array method like map, arrow functions can simplify the code and avoid issues with this binding.

What is Object.freeze() for?

	Object.freeze() is used to make an object immutable. Once an object is frozen, you cannot add, remove, or modify its properties. This is useful for creating constants or ensuring that an object remains unchanged throughout the program.
	
	const obj = { name: 'John' };
	Object.freeze(obj);
	obj.name = 'Doe'; // This will not change the name property
	
	
What is Object.seal() for?

	Object.seal() is used to prevent new properties from being added to an object and to mark all existing properties as non-configurable. This means you can still modify the values of existing properties, but you cannot delete them or add new ones.
	
	const obj = { name: 'John' };
	Object.seal(obj);

	obj.name = 'Jane'; // Allowed
	obj.age = 30; // Not allowed
	delete obj.name; // Not allowed
	
	
What is Object.preventExtensions() for?

	Object.preventExtensions() is a method in JavaScript that prevents new properties from being added to an object. However, it does not affect the deletion or modification of existing properties. This method is useful when you want to ensure that an object remains in a certain shape and no additional properties can be added to it.

	const obj = { name: 'John' };
	Object.preventExtensions(obj);

	obj.age = 30; // This will not work, as the object is not extensible
	console.log(obj.age); // undefined

Object.assign()
	
	The Object.assign() static method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the modified target object.
	
	const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
	const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

	const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

	console.log(target);

What is the difference between setTimeout(), setImmediate(), and process.nextTick()?

	setTimeout() schedules a callback to run after a minimum delay. setImmediate() schedules a callback to run after the current event loop completes. process.nextTick() schedules a callback to run before the next event loop iteration begins.

	setTimeout(() => console.log('setTimeout'), 0);
	setImmediate(() => console.log('setImmediate'));
	process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
	
Explain how prototypal inheritance works in JavaScript
	
	Prototypical inheritance in JavaScript is a way for objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has a special hidden property called [[Prototype]] (commonly accessed via __proto__ or using Object.getPrototypeOf()) that is a reference to another object, which is called the object's "prototype".


	When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object's __proto__, and the __proto__'s __proto__ and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the __proto__s or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain.


	// Parent object constructor.
	function Animal(name) {
	  this.name = name;
	}

	// Add a method to the parent object's prototype.
	Animal.prototype.makeSound = function () {
	  console.log('The ' + this.constructor.name + ' makes a sound.');
	};

	// Child object constructor.
	function Dog(name) {
	  Animal.call(this, name); // Call the parent constructor.
	}

	// Set the child object's prototype to be the parent's prototype.
	Object.setPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype, Animal.prototype);

	// Add a method to the child object's prototype.
	Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
	  console.log('Woof!');
	};

	// Create a new instance of Dog.
	const bolt = new Dog('Bolt');

	// Call methods on the child object.
	console.log(bolt.name); // "Bolt"
	bolt.makeSound(); // "The Dog makes a sound."
	bolt.bark(); // "Woof!"
	Things to note are:

	.makeSound is not defined on Dog, so the JavaScript engine goes up the prototype chain and finds .makeSound on the inherited Animal.
	Using Object.create() to build the inheritance chain is no longer recommended. Use Object.setPrototypeOf() instead.

Explain the concept of lexical scoping

	Lexical scoping means that the scope of a variable is determined by its location within the source code, and nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope. For example:

	function outerFunction() {
	  let outerVariable = 'I am outside!';

	  function innerFunction() {
		console.log(outerVariable); // 'I am outside!'
	  }

	  innerFunction();
	}

	outerFunction();
	In this example, innerFunction can access outerVariable because of lexical scoping
	
	
Set vs Map in JavaScript
	
	In JavaScript, Set and Map are two types of objects that are used for storing data in an ordered manner. Both these data structures are used to store distinct types of data inside the same object. In Maps, the data is stored as a key-value pair whereas in Set data is a single collection of values that are unique.

	JavaScript Set
		
	It is a collection of values that can be accessed without a specific key. The elements are unique and the addition of duplicates is not allowed. Sets are mostly used to remove duplicates from any other data structure

		let sample = new Set();
		sample.add("Hello");
		sample.add(1)
		sample.add("Bye")
		sample.add("@");
		 
		for (let item of sample) {
			console.log(item);
			}
		
		OUTPUT
		
		Hello
		1
		Bye
		@
		
		
	JavaScript Map
	
	Maps are used to store data in key-value pairs where keys are used to uniquely identify an element and values contain the data associated with it.
	
	let sample = new Map();
	sample.set("name", "Ram");
	sample.set("Role", "SDE")
	sample.set("Country", "India")
	 
	for (let item of sample) {
		console.log(item);
	}
	
	Output
	
	[ 'name', 'Ram' ]
	[ 'Role', 'SDE' ]
	[ 'Country', 'India' ]
	

WeakSet vs WeakMap in JavaScript

	In JavaScript, there are two types of references strong and weak. The WeakSet and WeakMap are called weak references. Since these are weak references they do not prevent garbage collection if they are the only reference to the object in the memory. These objects are rarely used but are useful when we want memory usage to be automatically managed.

	JavaScript WeakSet: It is used to store a collection of objects similar to that of set the only difference is that these values are only object and not some particular data type.
	
	var x = new WeakSet();
	var y = new WeakSet(null);
	x.add({});
	x.add({});
	console.log(x);
	console.log(y);
	
	Output:

	WeakSet {{…}, {…}}
	WeakSet {}
	
	JavaScript WeakMap: In JavaScript, the WeakMap is used to store value in a key-value pair but it is different as the entries are weakly referred to. The key should always be a JavaScript object but the value can be any primitive JavaScript data type.
	
	function myGeeks() {
		var looseMap = new WeakMap();
		looseMap.set({}, "Ram");
		looseMap.set({}, "Raj");
		looseMap.set({}, "Rahul");
		console.log(looseMap);
	}
	myGeeks();
	
	Output:

	WeakMap {{…} => 'Raj', {…} => 'Rahul', {…} => 'Ram'}
